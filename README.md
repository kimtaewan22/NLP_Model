## Title
> Android-Based System for Analyzing and Improving Negative Language Usage Habits
---
## Project Background

In contemporary society, language habits play a crucial role in our daily lives. Understanding and improving the language habits of children and adolescents can positively influence their growth and social interactions. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter contribute to the unconscious absorption of negative language and expressions by many individuals, leading to the tendency to incorporate them into everyday life. This not only affects children and adolescents but also adults, fostering negative language habits that can have adverse effects on personal and societal relationships. If this pattern persists, individuals may develop a habit of perceiving everything negatively.

This issue is particularly prevalent among children and adolescents, who easily adopt negative language while exchanging text messages through smartphones and Android devices in their daily lives. Recognizing and improving their language habits are crucial to preventing social conflicts and promoting a culture of positive dialogue.

The main focus of this research is to analyze the content of text messages sent from Android devices to determine how much negative expression children and adolescents use daily. The goal is to assess improvements in language habits compared to previous levels. Children and adolescents often engage in challenges with friends, such as making a bet to refrain from using negative language starting from the next day, as an attempt to improve their language habits. However, such challenges are often not followed through, and individuals find it challenging to accurately gauge how much negative expression they use daily.

To address this issue, the proposed solution involves analyzing text messages on Android devices to detect how much negative language users employ daily and providing them with feedback on their language habits.
